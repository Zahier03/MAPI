This project is planned to be free and open source to help other students. It is my contribution to society and the community.

Mapi is a project that utilizes artificial intelligence to address common learning challenges, specifically in researching and creating mind maps.
Mapi was created to represent the learning journey and experiences I encountered during my tertiary education. This project serves as my final year project in the Diploma in Electronic Engineering (Computer), focusing on the application of artificial intelligence.
